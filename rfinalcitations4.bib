	abstract = {The ability to obtain high-resolution chemical profiles across otoliths has expanded with technological advancements that prompted an explosion of data from diverse taxa in coastal, marine and freshwater systems worldwide. The questions pursued by most otolith chemists fall broadly into six categories: identifying origins, tracking migration, reconstructing environments, quantifying growth or physiology, validating ages and assessing diets. Advances in instrumentation have widened the periodic table of otolith elements, and two-dimensional mapping has further illuminated spatial heterogeneity across these complex structures. Although environmental drivers of observed elemental signatures in otoliths are often assumed to be paramount, multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors can disrupt simple relationships between an element and a single environmental parameter. An otolith chemical profile is not a direct photograph of an environment, but rather an impressionistic image filtered through the multifaceted experiences of the fish itself. A ‘signalto-noise’ approach that assesses the relative magnitudes of variation from intrinsic and extrinsic factors on chemical profiles may be a promising way to resolve the factor of interest against the ‘noise’ of others. A robust appreciation of environmental drivers, physiological regulation and calcification dynamics that affect the ability to effectively interpret otolith chemical patterns is necessary to drive the field forward.},

We used geochemical signatures in the otoliths of American shad Alosa sapidissima to determine natal origins and estimate rates of straying among river-specific populations along the U.S. Atlantic coast. Stable isotope (δ13C, δ18O and 87Sr:86Sr) and elemental (Mg: Ca, Mn: Ca, Sr: Ca and Ba: Ca) signatures in otoliths of juvenile American shad from rivers from Georgia to New Hampshire varied significantly, allowing for an average of 91\% cross-validated accuracy when classifying individual fish to their natal rivers. We also found significant interannual variability in the geochemical signatures from several rivers, due largely to differences in δ18O values among years. We then used the ground-truthed geochemical signatures in the otoliths of juvenile American shad to identify the natal origins of spawning adults in the York River system in Virginia. Approximately 6\% of the spawning adults collected in the York River were strays from other rivers. Of the remaining fish, 79\% were spawned in the Mattaponi River and 21\% in the Pamunkey River. The combined results of this and other recent studies suggest that although most American shad spawning in the York River were homing to their natal river, there was much less fidelity to individual tributaries. Small-scale straying could allow fish spawned in the Mattaponi River to subsidize spawning in the Pamunkey River, which has experienced persistent recruitment failure.},

The relative contributions of water and food sources to otolith aragonite were assessed using a simple linear isotope mixing model. Water sources contributed 83\% of Sr and 98\% of Ba in otoliths formed in spiked seawater. Our results indicate that water chemistry is the dominant factor controlling the uptake of Sr and Ba in the otoliths of marine fishes.

	abstract = {Minor and trace element analyses of fish otoliths (ear stones) may provide a high-resolution reconstruction of temperature histories and trace element compositions of aquatic systems where other environmental proxies are not available. However, before otoliths can be used to reconstruct water chemistry, it is essential to validate the assumption that trace metals in otoliths are deposited in proportion to dissolved concentrations in the ambient environment. We show, using a marine fish (Leiostomus xanthurus) reared in the laboratory under controlled experimental conditions, that otolith Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios are deposited in proportion to their respective ratios in ambient waters. Temperature significantly affected Sr incorporation but did not affect Ba incorporation in otoliths. Sr/Ca partition coefficients (DSr) were 0.182 and 0.205 at 20°C and 25°C, respectively. The partition coefficients for Ba/Ca were 0.055 at 20°C and 0.062 at 25°C. A nonlinearity in the relationship between DBa and ambient Ba concentrations suggested that extrapolation beyond the Ba levels used in the experiment was not justified. On the basis of our results, it should be possible to reconstruct Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca levels in environments inhabited by fish based on otolith chemistry. Furthermore, Sr/Ca thermometry may also be possible using fish otoliths, but validation of the temperature dependence of Sr/Ca in otoliths will be required. We believe otoliths represent an excellent, and as yet underused, record of the physicochemical properties of both modern and ancient aquatic environments.},

To test this theory, we documented energetic expenditures and travel speeds of 15 anadromous fish populations involving 9 species observed during their upstream migration. Parameters that characterized fish migratory behavior and the spawning river were calculated for each population. In most cases, cost per unit distance is not minimized and migratory strategy does not conform to the theoretical optimum. Populations that make long or difficult migrations are more efficient in their use of energy reserves than populations that make shorter migrations. Only populations that need all their energy to complete the migration swim at speeds that approach the theoretical optimum. Migration length may lead to improved migratory efficiency by selecting for larger body size, more accurate upstream orientation, and travel speeds that optimize energy efficiency. The failure to minimize energy expenditures is sometimes due to environmental constraints that exceed the physiological capacities of migrants. Minimizing the probablity of death due to exhaustion may be the major factor determining migratory behavior. Selection for energetic efficiency appears important only in cases where energy reserves are exhausted during migration.},

	abstract = {A revelatory look at the secrets of marine fish migration.Not since F. R. Harden Jones published his masterwork on fish migration in 1968 has a book so thoroughly demystified the subject. With stunning clarity, David Hallock Secor's Migration Ecology of Fishes finally penetrates the clandestine nature of marine fish migration. Secor explains how the four decades of research since Jones's classic have employed digital-age technologies—including electronic miniaturization, computing, microchemistry, ocean observing systems, and telecommunications—that render overt the previously hidden migration behaviors of fish. Emerging from the millions of observed, telemetered, simulated, and chemically traced movement paths is an appreciation of the individual fish. Members of the same populations may stay put, explore, delay, accelerate, evacuate, and change course as they conditionally respond to their marine existence. But rather than a morass of individual behaviors, Secor shows us that populations are collectively organized through partial migration, which causes groups of individuals to embark on very different migration pathways despite being members of the same population. Case studies throughout the book emphasize how migration ecology confounds current fisheries management. Yet, as Secor explains, conservation frameworks that explicitly consider the influence of migration on yield, stability, and resilience outcomes have the potential to transform fisheries management. A synthetic treatment of all marine fish taxa (teleosts and elasmobranchs), this book employs explanatory frameworks from avian and systems ecology while arguing that migrations are emergent phenomena, structured through schooling, phenotypic plasticity, and other collective agencies. The book provides overviews of the following concepts: • The comparative movement ecology of fishes and birds • The alignment of mating systems with larval dispersal • Schooling and migration as adaptations to marine food webs • Natal homing • Connectivity in populations and metapopulations • The contribution of migration ecology to population resilience},

The roles of spawning site fidelity and straying in structuring populations of anadromous smelt Osmerus mordax were examined in coastal Newfoundland through the analysis of otolith elemental composition and a series of adult tagging experiments. Otolith elemental baselines were generated from freshwater residents, estuarine juveniles and laboratory-held individuals (32 psu), using both a single-element (i.e. Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) and multivariate approach (i.e. discriminant function analysis). Ten spawning fish of unknown dispersal history were sampled from each of 6 spawning locations, and otolith composition was examined using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at 12 to 16 locations across each otolith. Single-element and multivariate approaches both indicated estuarine residency predominated, with limited marine (0.7\%) signatures indicative of rare marine movements. Multiyear spawning site fidelity was examined through a finclipping (2003, n = 7076) and visual implant elastomer (VIE) experiment (2004, n = 13 524), encompassing each of the 6 spawning locations. We observed limited straying, with 90 to 99\% annual spawning site fidelity. Tag returns declined significantly with distance from location of tagging, and declines were linear over small ({\textless} 50 km) distances (VIE: p {\textless} 0.001, r2 = 0.99; fin clipping: p {\textless} 0.001, r2 = 0.56). We conclude that population structure in anadromous smelt is maintained by small-scale habitat associations limited to a single estuary, supporting a hypothesis of demographic isolation among estuaries.},

	abstract = {Few estimates of migration rates or descriptions of behavior or survival exist for wild populations of out-migrating Pacific salmon smolts from natal freshwater rearing areas to the ocean. Using acoustic transmitters and fixed receiver arrays across four years (2010–2013), we tracked the migration of {\textgreater}1850 wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts from Chilko Lake, British Columbia, to the coastal Pacific Ocean ({\textgreater}1000 km distance). Cumulative survival to the ocean ranged 3–10\% among years, although this may be slightly underestimated due to technical limitations at the final receiver array. Distinct spatial patterns in both behavior and survival were observed through all years. In small, clear, upper-river reaches, downstream migration largely occurred at night at speeds up to 50 km/d and coincided with poor survival. Among years, only 57–78\% of smolts survived the first 80 km. Parallel laboratory experiments revealed excellent short-term survival and unhindered swimming performance of dummy-tagged smolts, suggesting that predators rather than tagging effects were responsible for the initial high mortality of acoustic-tagged smolts. Migration speeds increased in the Fraser River mainstem ( 220 km/d in some years), diel movement patterns ceased, and smolt survival generally exceeded 90\% in this segment. Marine movement rates and survival were variable across years, with among-year segment-specific survival being the most variable and lowest (19–61\%) during the final (and longest, 240 km) marine migration segment. Osmoregulatory preparedness was not expected to influence marine survival, as smolts could maintain normal levels of plasma chloride when experimentally exposed to saltwater (30 ppt) immediately upon commencing their migration from Chilko Lake. Transportation of smolts downstream generally increased survival to the farthest marine array. The act of tagging may have affected smolts in the marine environment in some years as dummy-tagged fish had poorer survival than control fish when transitioned to saltwater in laboratory-based experiments. Current fisheries models for forecasting the number of adult sockeye returning to spawn have been inaccurate in recent years and generally do not incorporate juvenile or smolt survival information. Our results highlight significant potential for early migration conditions to influence adult recruitment.},

Three of the most oft-assumed mechanisms for reducing risk for migrants are swamping predators with high densities, specific timing of migrations and increased body size. Assessing the relative importance of these mechanisms in reducing predation risk particularly for migrants is generally lacking due to the difficulties in tracking the fate of individuals and population-level characteristics simultaneously. We used acoustic telemetry to track migration behaviour and survival of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts released over a wide range of conspecific outmigration densities in a river associated with poor survival. The landscape was indeed high risk; smolt survival was poor (˜68\%) over 13·5 km of river examined even though migration was rapid (generally {\textless}48 h). Our results demonstrate that smolts largely employ swamping of predators to reduce predation risk. Increased densities of co-migrant conspecifics dramatically improved survival of smolts. The strong propensity for nocturnal migration resulted in smolts pausing downstream movements until the next nightfall, greatly increasing relative migration durations for smolts that could not traverse the study area in a single night. Smolt size did not appear to impact predation risk, potentially due to unique characteristics of the system or our inability to tag the entire size range of outmigrants. Movement behaviours were important in traversing this high-risk landscape and provide rare evidence for swamping to effectively reduce individual predation risk.},

With tens of thousands of tagged aquatic animals from a range of taxa, vast amounts of data have been generated. As data accumulate, it is useful to reflect on how this information has advanced our understanding of aquatic animals and improved management and conservation. Here we identify knowledge gaps and discuss opportunities to advance aquatic animal science and management using acoustic telemetry monitoring. Current technological and analytical shortfalls still need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of acoustic monitoring. Future interdisciplinary research that relies on transmitter-borne sensors and emphasizes hypothesis testing will amplify the benefits of this technology.},

Animal movement can impact ecosystems through the transfer of materials, by shifting the intensity of trophic interactions across space and through time, and by propagating disease and genetic material. Migration can be differentiated from other modes of animal movement in terms of spatial extent and temporal predictability, and these differences have consequences for interactions (such as competition and predation) with non-migrating species. The chapter focuses specifically on ungulate migrations, given their highly vulnerable status, and examines through a series of theoretical exercises their potential impacts on aspects of ecosystem function and community composition.},

These developments are revolutionizing the scope and scale of questions that can be asked about the causes and consequences of movement and are redefining how we view and manage individuals, populations, and entire ecosystems.

	doi = {10.2307/1438482},
	abstract = {HE adjectives anadromous and catadromous are in common use by ichthyologists and biologists in general for fishes which migrate from salt to fresh water or from fresh to salt water to breed. However, this widely understood usage of these terms has been far from universal. Alexander Meek (1916), in the most important general work in English on fish migration, vastly broadened the scope of these terms by applying anadromous to any upward or shoreward migration, even in the sea, and catadromous to any seaward, offshore or downward migration. The authority of Meek's great work has caused a number of influential English-speaking biological writers, such as Kyle (1926: 53 et seq.) and J. Arthur Thomson (1929), to accept this wider usage. Even Scheuring, a German, in the most voluminous work yet published on fish migration, follows Meek (see especially Scheuring, 1929: 409). On the other hand, Regan (1929: see under "Breeding and Development") and Norman (1931: 265-266; 1937: 94-95), two of the most eminent of all ichthyologists, have preferred to ignore Meek's emendations. Furthermore, despite Meek, Kyle and Scheuring, most North American ichthyologists continue to use the adjectives anadromous and catadromous almost exclusively in the older, narrower sense, even though they may be quite aware of the broader usage of Meek.},

	abstract = {It is well-established that sampling and sample processing can easily introduce contamination into dissolved trace element samples if precautions are not taken. However, work in remote locations sometimes precludes bringing bulky clean lab equipment into the field and likewise may make timely transport of samples to the lab for processing impossible. Straightforward syringe filtration methods are described here for collecting small quantities (15 mL) of 0.45- and 0.02-microm filtered river water in an uncontaminated manner. These filtration methods take advantage of recent advances in analytical capabilities that require only small amounts of waterfor analysis of a suite of dissolved trace elements. Filter clogging and solute rejection artifacts appear to be minimal, although some adsorption of metals and organics does affect the first approximately 10 mL of water passing through the filters. Overall the methods are clean, easy to use, and provide reproducible representations of the dissolved and colloidal fractions of trace elements in river waters. Furthermore, sample processing materials can be prepared well in advance in a clean lab and transported cleanly and compactly to the field. Application of these methods is illustrated with data from remote locations in the Rocky Mountains and along the Yukon River. Evidence from field flow fractionation suggests that the 0.02-microm filters may provide a practical cutoff to distinguish metals associated with small inorganic and organic complexes from those associated with silicate and oxide colloids.},
